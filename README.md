🚀 Face Recognition System
A real-time face recognition system using OpenCV and face_recognition for detecting and identifying faces from a webcam feed.

📌 Features
✅ Real-time Face Detection & Recognition using OpenCV
✅ Efficient Processing by resizing frames for better performance
✅ Multiple Face Recognition with pre-registered users
✅ Automatic Name Tagging based on stored encodings
✅ Frame Optimization for faster detection

🛠️ Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python

Libraries: OpenCV, face_recognition, NumPy

📂 How It Works
1.Loads known face images (harsh.jpg, Hritik.jpg) and encodes them.

2.Captures frames from the webcam and resizes them for faster processing.

3.Detects and encodes faces in real-time.

4.Compares detected faces with stored encodings to identify people.

5.Draws rectangles and labels around recognized faces.

6.Press 'q' to exit the program.
